# BikeNest Readme

# Introduction
BikeNest is an Android app displaying bike parking locations in the city of Chicago. The current features of the app are a login/register system and a map view interface displaying the bike racks as way points using the Google maps API.

# Technical Architecture
Below is the technical architecture diagram of our app. The user is greeted with a main page where they can login, register, or continue as a guest. They can then navigate to the map activity, where they can find/select bike rack markers. All of the database features of the app are supported by Google Firebase.
